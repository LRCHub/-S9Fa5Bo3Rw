I feel something different
I don't know what it is
Something's really missing in my
life
Now I know what it is
My weakness calls out my name
It takes me to the place where I
used to live home
Someone talks to me nicely I can
't trust them
sometimes you make me feel bette
r feeling not alone
My weakness saying to me let's g
o back home now
Don't make me feel so (go back h
ome)
Never say you know me
Do you?
Someone whisperers to me why not
go back home
Sometimes I almost agree
“yeah”
But I think is not that time
My  weakness staring at me
As my loved one my sweet place
Where she used to sleep with me
I need more time to see to think
I need more time to see to think
of you think of you
Don't make me feel so (go back h
ome)
Never say you know me
Don't make me feel so (go back h
ome)
You never know who I am
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be like you
who I used to be
If no one ever hears me or sees
me
If no one listens to me cares ab
out me
I'll sing for you
I'll sing for you
Like I user to do
I feel some thing different
I don't know what it is
Something 's really missing in m
y life
Now I know what it is
My weakness calls out my name
It takes me to the place where I
used to live
